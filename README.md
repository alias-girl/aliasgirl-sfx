# aliasgirls-audio
aliasgirl's personal audio library.

### If you're looking for something specific, there's a teensy-tiny bit of digging required, so here's the basic rundown of the directory structuring:
1. First is "Source Media" (Video games, movies, TV, etc.)
2. Second is "Alphanumeric Ordering" (0-9, A-Z)
3. Last is the Audio Folders themselves.

**_Should_ be pretty easy enough to understand, right?** :melting_face:

> [!NOTE]
> *A large portion of the audio files and their parent folders were pulled from www.sounds-resource.com. More sources my come soon.*

> [!NOTE]
> **If you are employed by or are individually the owner of any licensed contents within this repository and would like to have said content removed, feel free to make an issue post or email me about it at tomboytransgirl@gmail.com. I don't frequently look at either, so keep that in mind.**

> [!WARNING]
> **Feel free to use anything you want, at your own risk. I own none of the audio held in this repository (unless clearly stated otherwise), so if anything is licensed and you end up recieving any kind of repurcussions or notices stemming from the usage of any particular item that you pulled from here, please don't come whining about it to me. I'm mostly just using this repository for personal reasons, as well as archival, in preparation for the rare case that something is mysteriously wiped from the internet. (Probably not gonna happen, but better safe than sorry).**
