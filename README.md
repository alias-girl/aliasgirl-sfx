Feel free to use anything you want, at your own risk. I own none of the audio held in this repository (unless clearly stated otherwise), so if anything is licensed and you end up recieving any kind of repurcussions or notices from the usage of any particular object, don't come whining about it to me. I'm mostly just using this repository for personal reasons, as well as archival, in the rare case that something is mysteriously wiped from the internet. (Probably not gonna happen, but better safe than sorry).

*If you are employed by or are individually the owner of any licensed contents within this repository and would like to have said content removed, feel free to make an issue post or email me about it at tomboytransgirl@gmail.com. I don't frequently look at either, so keep that in mind.*

*Most of the sounds were pulled from www.sounds-resource.com.*
